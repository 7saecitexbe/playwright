One of the cracked versions of Havij is made by Exidous, a hacker who claims to have modified the original Havij 1.15 Pro and added some features and fixes. This version of Havij can be downloaded from various file sharing websites, such as 4shared[^1^] or Google Drive[^2^]. However, downloading cracked software from untrusted sources may pose security risks, such as malware infection or data theft.
 
Therefore, users who want to download Havij cracked by Exidous should exercise caution and scan the downloaded files with antivirus software before running them. Alternatively, users can opt for other legitimate tools for SQL injection, such as sqlmap or sqlninja, which are open source and free to use. Users can also learn more about SQL injection techniques and prevention from reputable sources, such as OWASP or W3Schools.
  
Havij was developed by ITSecTeam, an Iranian security company, in 2009. The name Havij means "carrot" in Persian, which is a slang term for a tool that penetrates web applications. Havij has a graphical user interface that makes it easy to use for beginners and experts alike. Havij can automate various tasks related to SQL injection, such as finding vulnerable parameters, extracting data from databases, executing commands on the server, and accessing the file system.
 
However, Havij also has some limitations and drawbacks. For example, Havij only supports Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MS Access databases. Havij may also fail to detect some types of SQL injection vulnerabilities, such as blind or time-based SQL injection. Havij may also generate noisy and suspicious traffic that can alert web administrators or security systems. Moreover, Havij may violate the ethical and legal boundaries of hacking, as it can be used for malicious purposes without the consent of the web owners.
 
Therefore, users who want to download Havij cracked by Exidous should be aware of the risks and responsibilities involved in using this tool. Users should only use Havij for educational or testing purposes on their own web applications or with permission from the web owners. Users should also respect the intellectual property rights of ITSecTeam and avoid using cracked versions of Havij that may infringe their license agreement. Users should also update their web applications and databases regularly to prevent SQL injection attacks from Havij or other tools.
  
In conclusion, Havij is a powerful and popular tool for SQL injection, but it also has some drawbacks and limitations. Users who want to download Havij cracked by Exidous should be careful and cautious, as they may face security and legal issues. Users should also consider using other tools or methods for SQL injection, such as sqlmap or sqlninja, which are free and open source. Users should also learn more about SQL injection and how to prevent it from reputable sources, such as OWASP or W3Schools.
